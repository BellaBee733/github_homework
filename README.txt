My name is Isabella Borrero and I am a Masters in Agricultural Scieces 
student. My research interests are in developing sustainable, alternative 
disease management strategies through alternative soil substrates with a 
focus on characterizing the rhizosphere and bulk soil microbiome in these 
substrates in a greenhouse setting. I will also be potentially looking 
into the metabolimcs of these communities.
